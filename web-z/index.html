<h1>The Insperation</h1>
<p>As a child I always knew that I wanted to do something creative. I always had backup ideas like a nail tech or a tattoo artist, but in the end I was always led back to being a cake decorator. 

</p>
  
  <p>Growing up I loved watching Food Network and my favorite show was Ace Of Cakes. It was a show about Duff Goldman and his amazing cake shop. It was like Cake Boss before Cake Boss was around. Duff's amazing cakes truly inspired me to fully dive into cake decorating. From me very first cake to now it was all because of watching Duff pour his heart and soul into his cakes.
</p>
  
  <h2> Working Now </h2>
  
  <p> Duff was my inspiration to start decorating cakes but now I have current inspiration to keep me going. I am the oldest child of 7 kids all together. My job as a big sister is to make sure that my younger siblings have a person to look up too other than their parents. Now this doesn't mean i want them to be in the same field but i do want them to know they can do whatever they want to do and that they can be the greatest  at it as long as they work as hard as they can. 
  </p>
  
  <h3> For The Furture</h3>
  
  <p>I know I want to be succesful no matter what i do, being able to know that I will be cable to leave something amazing when im done working.</p>
